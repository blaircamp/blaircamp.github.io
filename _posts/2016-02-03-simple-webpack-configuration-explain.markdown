I have been experimenting with reactjs the last couple of months and with that
I started using [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) to handle building the projects.  I found the configuration for webpack a bit confusing when I first started out so I want to document how my basic configuration is setup and why.

A link to the full webpack configuration is I am using is [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blaircamp/react-webpack-project/master/webpack.config.js)

### Entry points

```javascript
  entry : [
    'webpack-dev-server/client?http://0.0.0.0:8081',
    'webpack/hot/only-dev-server',
    './index.jsx'
  ]

```

#### What is this?

* First Entry
```
webpack-dev-server/client?http://0.0.0.0:8081 //WebpackDevServer host and port
```
This adds the node_modules/webpack-dev/client/index.js script into the bundle.  This will connect to the webpack-dev-server and reload the application when new changes are detected. The URL is pointing to the webback-dev-server.
```
//command line used for the dev server
webpack-dev-server --progress --profile --colors --hot --port 8081
```

* Second Entry
```
webpack/hot/only-dev-server //"only" prevents reload on syntax errors
```
This adds the node_modules/webpack/hot/only-dev-server.js script into the bundle.  This will determine if the change that has been made can be applied as a hot update without refreshing the page and losing the current state of the application.   More information on hot module replacement in webpack can be found [here](https://webpack.github.io/docs/hot-module-replacement-with-webpack.html)

* Third Entry
```
./index.jsx //App entry point
```
This is the main entry point into the application, everything else is there to facilitate reloading the page when webpack rebuilds the bundle after a change has been made.


### Output
```javascript
  output: {
          path: path.join(__dirname, 'public'),
          filename: 'bundle.js'
  }
```

#### What is this?
This tells webpack where to put the bundled JavaScript file it has created. The path setting points to the directory where it should be saved, and the filename is what it should be called


### Resolving Extensions
```javascript
  resolve: {
        extensions: ['', '.js', '.jsx','.css']
  },
```

#### What is this?
The ** resolve.extensions ** setting tells webpack what file extensions it should search for while resolving modules.  In the example below, if you want to import a local stylesheet for a reactjs component you will need to have the .css extension in the extension array.

```javascript
  import style from './style'
```

### Modules
```javascript
  module: {
      loaders: [
          {
              test: /\.jsx?$/,
              exclude: /(node_modules|bower_components)/,
              loaders: ['react-hot', 'babel'],
          },

          {
              test: /\.css$/,
              loader: 'style-loader!css-loader?modules'
          }
      ]
  }
```

#### What is this?
This setting sets up the different tasks the webpack will perform on each file
it finds.  

The test setting is the condition that must be met before the loaders are applied to
a particular file.  So for the first loader, the test is a regular expression
to see if the filename ends with the jsx file extension.

The exclude setting is like the test setting but it must return false, or must
not be met.  We do not want to traverse any node_modules and bower_components
so if the filename contains either of these names we don't process it.

In the first setting (jsx) we use the loaders setting.  This is an array of the
loaders we want to use to process a file. Each file that means the jsx test
condition will be processed through the react-hot loader and the passed onto
the babel loader. The react-hot loader is used to detect when a change can be
accomplished with a hot-reload vs a full page refresh done by the webpack-dev-server.
The babel loader is used to translate ES6 syntax into the ES5 syntax that browsers
can use now.

In the second setting (css) we use the loader setting which specifies loaders
in a ()!) delimited string.  Using the (!) delimited syntax for the loader
setting, any file meeting the test condition will be passed first to the
style loader and then onto the css-loader.  The combination of the style-loader
and css-loader is to make it possible to embed stylesheets into your webpack
JavaScript bundle.  This allows you to modularize your stylesheets for your
application instead of having single stylesheet. On the css-loader we pass in
the query parameter 'modules'.  This is a setting telling the css-loader to use
the module mode.  You can read more on those [here](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules).


If you want to know more about loaders and their different configuration settings more information can be
found [here](https://webpack.github.io/docs/loaders.html)

### Dev Server Configuration
```javascript
  devServer: {
        contentBase: "./public",
        noInfo: true, //  --no-info option
        inline: true
  },
```

#### What is this?
This setting is used to configure the webpack-dev server that the configuration
is passed into.

The ** contentBase ** setting tells the server to serve the files from this directory path.

The ** noInfo ** setting is used to suppress some information.

The ** inline ** setting is used to add the webpack-dev-server runtime into the
webpack bundle

This configuration is the same as running this on the command line web starting
the webpack-dev server.

```
webpack-dev-server --context-base './public ' --no-info  --inline
```

More information on these swtiches and configuration can be found [here](https://webpack.github.io/docs/webpack-dev-server.html#webpack-dev-server-cli)

### All Together Now
```javascript
var webpack = require('webpack');
var path = require('path');

module.exports = {
    entry: [
    'webpack-dev-server/client?http://0.0.0.0:8081', // WebpackDevServer host and port
    'webpack/hot/only-dev-server',
    './index.jsx' // Your app ºs entry point
  ],
    devtool: process.env.WEBPACK_DEVTOOL || 'source-map',
    output: {
        path: path.join(__dirname, 'public'),
        filename: 'bundle.js'
    },
    resolve: {
        extensions: ['', '.js', '.jsx','.css']
    },
    module: {
        loaders: [
            {
                test: /\.jsx?$/,
                exclude: /(node_modules|bower_components)/,
                loaders: ['react-hot', 'babel'],
            },

            {
                test: /\.css$/,
                loader: 'style-loader!css-loader?modules'
            }
        ]
    },
    devServer: {
        contentBase: "./public",
        noInfo: true, //  --no-info option
        inline: true
    },
    plugins: [
      new webpack.NoErrorsPlugin()
    ]
};
```
